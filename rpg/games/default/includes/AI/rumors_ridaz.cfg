//rumors for the people of Ridaz
//==============================


//How to include this script
//==========================

//add to the script of the NPC: include "includes/AI/rumors_ridaz"
//and to the main dialogue: r_response "Did you hear any rumors?" (concatword "rumor" (+ 1 (rnd $number_rumors)))


//How to extend this script
//=========================
//in case the value of number_rumors was 8
//name the start dialogue of your rumor "rumor9"

//then use the normal dialogue scripting
//be sure to increase the value of number_rumors


//TODO
//====
//- add more rumors (bandits; Tormund & Brannen; Mudeater; quality of shops)
//- let Corey correct the language of the rumors


//Start of code
//=============

number_rumors = 2 //total number of rumors - increase it when you add new rumors!


//Arus
