"There’s this little dinner far away in another part of the city;  it takes a while to get there, the food is terrible, and the service is pretty lackluster, but I always find myself going back to it. I showed up at the dinner today, alone, just like I always do.  I walk over to my usual spot against the window on the left side of the diner; I sit quietly down, and begin to gently tap my foot against the checkered tiles covering the floor. I decide to gaze around the restaurant as I wait for the waiter to arrive; the walls we’re painted a paleish green in a very amateurish manner, it gives me the feelings that if I stared long enough, that the paint would slowly start to peel off. The checkered tiling didn’t look much better, while the floors were swept and washed regularly, every third tile had a color that didn’t match the rest of the floor, making the rest of the room look tacky and if a blind man was the one that decorated it. As I continue to gaze across the ugly room, the door on the other side of the diner open’s, and out comes the reason I bother to show up here. An averaged sized girl about the age of 18 begins to walk towards me, her plain white shirt, obviously a couple sizes too small for her, clings tightly against her chest, accentuating the size and shape of her supple breasts.“Hi Kiyoshi-kun!” she nearly shouts as she makes it over to my table, pulling out a pad of paper and a pen from the pocket of her red pants, “What would you like today?”“Umm….the usual I guess, Atsuko-chan” I say, taking the chance to examine her features up close. Her hair is a bright blonde color and is long and straight, gently laying over her ears and dangling in front of her large breasts. The girls eyes are a bright blue color that always seem to flicker (in what I assume happens to be happiness) every time she sees me. The rest of her face seemed well proportioned, like everything is perfectly settled in a spot that makes the rest seem even more beautiful. Her lips we’re of a bright red color that always make her wide smile appear even larger, her teeth we’re pearly white and completely aligned with one another.“Awww Kiyoshi, you’re never any fun, always doing the same boring ol’ thing” she giggle’s as she says this, giving me a small wink as she heads back to get my order. While I’ve heard all of that before, my face still manages to blush. Atsuko’s voice was just as beautiful as she was; it was higher pitched, but not at a glass-shattering level, and always seemed to convey her emotions very well."] [ //0
